# About our impact on the planet ... 

Yes, it's real.

Yes, it's bad.

Yes, it's us. 

No, it's not too late.

No, it isn't just climate change.

# Why R?

Really good at statistics

Facilitates transparency and reproducibility

The R ecosystem (R + RStudio + GitHub + RMarkdown + ...) enables us to [do better science in less time](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0160) (*email me for a PDF*)

*Plus:* Spatial data analysis, handling netcdf files, "soup to nuts" analytical workflows, ...

# Species on the move

Explaining the past $\neq$ predicting the future

Ecosystems are very, very complex 

---

# My work

**Goal:** simulating near-term shifts in species' distributions in response to temperature

--

**Problem:** our only data are annual surveys of where fish were found, and how many

--

**Solution:** fit mechanistic models to historical data to estimate process rates and simulate the future

---

# The finer details

Fitted as a hierarchical Bayesian model using [Stan](https://mc-stan.org/)

Packages: [rstan](https://mc-stan.org/users/interfaces/rstan), [rstanarm](https://mc-stan.org/rstanarm/), [tidybayes](http://mjskay.github.io/tidybayes/)

Core model features

* Spatially structured: 1Â° patches along a coastline
* Age structured: adults reproduce, cohorts move through ages 
* Most process rates estimated in model
* One process rate (reproduction, movement, or mortality) is temperature-dependent
* *Only fitted to historical data on abundance and distribution*
* Fitting 1972-2005, testing 2006-2015
* Competing annual forecast against different model types
